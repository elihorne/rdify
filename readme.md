A simple Chrome extension to forward open.spotify links over to [RDIO](http://rdio.com).

[Download and Install](http://x.elihorne.com/chrome/rdify)


#### Usage
Visit an open.spotify.com URL for an album or track (playlists are not supported) and get redirected to Rdio

> [open.spotify.com/album/...](open.spotify.com/album/3hVR63Y2ElBoxmzThy80nG)

#### Uninstalling
Because this is only a [content script](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/content_scripts.html), you won't see the icon anywhere in Chrome's UI. To uninstall, simply visit *chrome://extensions* in the omnibar
