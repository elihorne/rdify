A simple Chrome extension to forward open.spotify links over to [RDIO](http://rdio.com).

#### Installation
> Running Chrome and have an [Rdio](http://rdio.com) account? [Download and Install](http://elihorne.com/rdify/)

#### Usage
Visit an open.spotify.com URL for an album or track (playlists are not supported) and get redirected to Rdio.

> **Example:** [http://open.spotify.com/album/...](http://open.spotify.com/album/3hVR63Y2ElBoxmzThy80nG)

#### Uninstalling
Because this is only a [content script](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/content_scripts.html), you won't see the icon anywhere in Chrome's UI. To uninstall, simply visit **chrome://extensions** in the omnibar.
